# InvoicePrinter Server

InvoicePrinter contains a built in server that can be run from a command line with `invoice_printer_server`.

Apart from this you can also manually mount the server inside of your Rack application.

## Running the server

### From command line

Once installed, InvoicePrinter provides `invoice_printer_server` executable that starts the Puma server:

```bash
invoice_printer_server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000
```

`-h` defines a host and `-p` defines a port. For help you can run `--help`.

By default server binds to `0.0.0.0:9393`.

### As mountable Rack app

If you want you can always run the server from your custom program or mount it directly from a Rack app.

`InvoicePrinter::Server` is a Rack app as any other. Example:

```ruby
require 'rack/handler/puma'
require 'invoice_printer/server'

Rack::Handler::Puma.run InvoicePrinter::Server.freeze.app
```

## Available API

Endpoints accept similar arguments as the corresponding methods to `InvoicePrinter`. `render` is used for directly getting the PDF output whereas `print` would accept `filename` option and save the document to that
file.

A content type is always `application/json` both for requests and responses.

### `POST /render`

Directly render PDF data.

Options:

- `document` - JSON representation of the document
- `labels` - JSON for labels
- `font` - path to font file
- `stamp` - path to stamp file
- `logo` - path to logotype file
- `background` - path to background file
- `page_size` - letter or A4 page size

On success a `200` response is returned:

```json
{ "result": "ok", "data": "base64 encoded PDF document" }
```

On error a `400` response is returned:

```json
{ "result": "error", "error": "error description" }
```
